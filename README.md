# WedemyClient

(Frontend Repo). Clone of Udemy, built using Vue 3 + Typescript + Element Plus + Injector/Provider API (No Vuex!). Almost
all components have been built with Options API. This App is also integrated with PayPal and CreditCard checkout (both
powered by **Braintree Payments**). The Backend is a Java Springboot application.

## Live Demo (coming soon)

The Demo uses Sandbox (Test) Mode of Braintree Payments. No actual money will be deducted on Checkout. You may use test
credit-card numbers [listed here](https://developer.paypal.com/braintree/docs/guides/credit-cards/testing-go-live/java). Also, this demo serves
embedded Content from YouTube with "no-cookie" option, which means tracking is disabled.
