(Frontend Repo). Clone of Udemy, PWA (progressive web app) built using Vue 3 + Typescript + Element Plus UI (no VueX). This
App is also integrated with PayPal and CreditCard checkout (both powered by **Braintree Payments**). For Braintree Payments tutorials and samples, please see
the [official docs for JS](https://developer.paypal.com/braintree/docs/guides/drop-in/setup-and-integration/javascript/v3). (Will require a backend server)

## Backend Repo

The backend is a separate Java Springboot application [available here](https://github.com/Longwater1234/WedemyServer).

## Install

```sh
npm install
```

## Usage

In development, the app runs on port 8080 by default. You can change it in [vue.config.js](vue.config.js). 

```sh
npm run serve
```

For production, run `npm run build`, then see official Vue CLI guide on [deployment](https://cli.vuejs.org/guide/deployment.html), depending on your platform of choice.

## [Live Demo](https://wedemy.up.railway.app/) - updated 2023 Jan

The Demo uses Sandbox (Dev) Mode of Braintree Payments. No actual money will be deducted on Checkout. You may use TEST
credit-card numbers [listed here](https://developer.paypal.com/braintree/docs/guides/credit-cards/testing-go-live/java).
Also, this Demo serves embedded Content from YouTube (for simplicity) with "no-cookie" option, which means tracking is disabled ‚úÖ.
