# WedemyClient

Clone of Udemy, built using Vue 3 + Typescript + Element Plus + Injector/Provide API (No Vuex!). I decided to **NOT** to
use Composition API, despite being on Vue 3. All components are built with in Options API.

## Libraries used

- Axios
- [Element Plus UI Framework](https://element-plus.org/en-US/)
- validator.js
- Prettier
